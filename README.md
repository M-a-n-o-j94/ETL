Weather Data Extraction Project
Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, having access to real-time weather information is crucial for various applications, including travel planning, event management, and agricultural practices. The challenge is to efficiently gather and present current weather data from multiple cities using an external weather API. This project aims to automate the process of fetching weather data for a predefined list of cities, organizing it into a structured format, and making it easily accessible for further analysis or visualization.

Solution Overview
To address this problem, I developed a Python application that leverages the Weather API to extract current weather data for a specified list of cities. The solution consists of the following steps:

API Setup and Request Handling:

Utilized the Weather API to retrieve current weather data by making HTTP GET requests.
Handled responses in JSON format to extract relevant weather details.
Data Extraction and Structuring:

Created a function (current_weather) that accepts a city name and fetches its current weather information.
Extracted essential fields from the JSON response, including:
City Name
Region
Country
Temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
Weather Condition
Humidity
Wind Direction
Pressure
Cloud Coverage
Visibility
Local Time
Organized this data into a structured format using a dictionary.
Data Storage and Presentation:

Converted the structured data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Initialized an empty DataFrame to store weather data for all specified cities.
Iterated through the list of cities, calling the current_weather function and appending the results to the main DataFrame.
Printed the final DataFrame to present the collected weather data in a clear and organized manner.
Conclusion
This project successfully automates the process of gathering real-time weather data for multiple cities, providing a structured dataset that can be utilized for further analysis or visualization. The implementation demonstrates the use of APIs, data extraction, and data manipulation with Python and Pandas, which are essential skills in data engineering.

Output
You can attach the output of the project, showing the DataFrame of current weather data for each city, in your GitHub repository to provide a visual representation of the results.
